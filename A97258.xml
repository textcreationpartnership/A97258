            <title>The poores advocate in 8 parts. Shewing, what an incomparable favour it is to the rich: that there are poor to accept of their charity, had they the wit to know it. Wherein is also made plain, that bounty and frugality is the best and surest way to plenty: with many other rational, and strong inducements to make men liberal; were it but for their own ends. Being enough (with the blessing of God) to change even a Nabal into a Zaccheus. By R. Yonnge [sic], florilegus. Who most earnestly begs of all rich men especially, and that for the poors sake, for Christs and the Gospels sake, but most of all for their own (even if their bodies, names, estates, precious souls and posterities) sake; to lay to heart, what is herein propounded to them out of Gods word, touching the poor: and then certainly, they will neither spend so excessively, nor heap up wealth so unmeasurably as they do; when millions of their poor brethren (for whom God would become man and die to redeem) are in such want, that I want words to express it.</title>

            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               </p>
               <p>It is ſaid, <hi>Luke</hi> 18.8. <hi>When the Son of man commeth, ſhall he finde faith on the earth?</hi> So when the Son of man commeth, ſhall he finde Charity on the earth? I fear no. For as now we have a great deal of <hi>faith (ſuch as it is)</hi> and but little or no <hi>Charity; (ſuch as it ſhould be)</hi> ſo then will he finde neither <hi>Faith</hi> not <hi>Charity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When <hi>Abrahams ſervant</hi> ſaw the charity, courteſie, and great care which <hi>Rebecka</hi> ſhewed to him and his; being a ſtranger: it is ſaid, <hi>He wondred at her, and held his peace! Gen.</hi> 24.18, to 22. It were a wonder indeed! to ſee the like in our dayes. <hi>Be not forgetful</hi> (ſaith the <hi>Apoſtle</hi>) <hi>to lodge ſtrangers: for thereby ſome have received Angels into their houſes unawares,</hi> Heb. 13.2. So did <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Lot,</hi> and many others: but for all this poſſibility of happineſs; few will put it to the venture: And were they indeed <hi>Angels,</hi> without <hi>Angels in their purſes</hi> to pay for it; they ſhould finde but cold entertainment.</p>
               <p>Again, <hi>our bleſſed Saviour</hi> tells us, <hi>He that receiveth you, receiveth me; and he that receiveth me, receiveth him that ſent me.</hi> And that, <hi>Whoſoever ſhall give unto one of theſe little ones to drink; a cup of cold water, only in the name of a Diſciple: Verely, I ſay unto you, he ſhall not loſe his reward,</hi> Matth. 10.40, 41, 42. But for all that, ſhould <hi>Chriſt</hi> come to <hi>Rich men</hi> in theſe dayes, in his own perſon; as he did to the <hi>woman of Samaria;</hi> and demand a ſmall matter of them; he ſhould receive but a flowt, and a churliſh denial as then he did, <hi>John</hi> 4.7, to 13. They will rather hazard the loſs of ſuch a friend as <hi>Christ</hi> himſelf: then the leaſt loſs by a friend of his ſending. In <hi>Deut.</hi> 16.17. Every man is commanded to give, <hi>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as God hath bleſt him.</hi> And ſo in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 16.2. And a man would think, that upon whom <hi>God</hi> beſtoweth moſt of his <hi>outward bleſſings:</hi> of them he ſhould receive the greateſt <hi>inward thanks.</hi> But it would amaze a man to ſee! How many <hi>Rich men,</hi> whom <hi>God</hi> hath bleſt with mighty eſtates, together with all that heart can wiſh; perhaps raiſed them from beggers, to be the beſt in their Pariſhes: and yet like beaſts or blocks; they are ſo far from returning the leaſt thanks to the giver; that (not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding our ſo much means of light and grace) they have not the
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:169975:4"/>leaſt <hi>knowledge,</hi> or <hi>fear,</hi> or <hi>love of God</hi> in them: but even hate him and his people, and oppoſe all proceedings that may promote <hi>the glory of God,</hi> and <hi>the Churches good.</hi> In ſo much that their <hi>unthankfulneſs,</hi> hath ſtriven with <hi>Gods goodneſs</hi> for the victory: as <hi>Abſolon</hi> ſtrove with <hi>David,</hi> whether the <hi>Father</hi> ſhould be more <hi>kinde</hi> to the <hi>ſon,</hi> or the ſon more <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde</hi> to the <hi>Father.</hi> They have been fatted with <hi>Gods bleſſings,</hi> and now they ſpurn at his <hi>precepts.</hi> Reſembling the <hi>Leopard,</hi> who wrongs him moſt, that gives him moſt fodder.</p>
               <p>But, ô the ſordidneſs of theſe <hi>ſwine.</hi> In reaſon we may well afford <hi>our ſuperfluities,</hi> where we owe <hi>our ſelves</hi> and all that we have or hold. And that by how much we receive more bleſſings then others: we ſhould <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">

                  </hi> theſe <hi>natural bruit beaſts.</hi> Beat with me, for it is not poſſible to expreſſe, either their baſeneſſe or blockiſhneſſe. It is to be obſerved, that general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly men are moſt thankful in a mean or middle condition. As when <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> had but two <hi>Tribes,</hi> he was moſt thankful; yea, he was never ſo ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, as when he was <hi>hunted like a Partridge,</hi> 1 Sam. 26.20. <hi>Jonah</hi> was at beſt, in the <hi>Whales belly.</hi> And daily experience teacheth, That as we grow <hi>rich in temporals;</hi> we grow <hi>poor in ſpirituals.</hi> Yea, not ſeldome have good men (in our apprehenſion) been lifted up ſo high with their wealth and greatneſſe: as to loſe the ſight, both of the <hi>ground,</hi> whence they roſe, and of the <hi>hand</hi> that advanced them. For as <hi>fat men</hi> are more ſubject to <hi>diſeaſes</hi> of the <hi>body;</hi> ſo are <hi>Rich men</hi> to thoſe of the <hi>minde.</hi> Tis the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery of the poor, to be <hi>neglected of men:</hi> Prov. 19.7. 'tis the miſery of the rich to <hi>neglect their God.</hi> The full gorged <hi>Faulcon</hi> will not know her <hi>Maſter,</hi> or turn unto him. Many receive <hi>Millions</hi> from <hi>God,</hi> yet are not ſo thankful; as they who have received nothing but <hi>from hand to mouth. The poor,</hi> ſaith <hi>Chriſt, receive the Gospel;</hi> though the rich are more bound.</p>
               <p>And the truth is, <hi>pride</hi> and <hi>forgetfulneſs,</hi> is commonly all the return we make to <hi>God</hi> for his bleſſings, as a world of inſtances prove, of which theſe are pregnant, and well worth thy turning to <hi>Jer.</hi> 22.21. <hi>Job</hi> 22.17, 18. <hi>Pſal,</hi> 10.4, 5, 6. <hi>Deut.</hi> 32.15, 18.</p>
               <p>Whence it is, That the <hi>Lord</hi> ſo oft fore-warneth men to <hi>beware leſt they forget him, and their hearts be lifted up ſo ſoon as he hath bleſt, and advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced them:</hi> for which ſee that notable place, <hi>Deut.</hi> 6.10, 11, 12, <hi>&amp;</hi> 8.11, to 15. for I am ſo tied to brevity, that I cannot ſtand to repeat every Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture.</p>

               <p>ANd indeed this is the main reaſon, why the <hi>beſt</hi> are <hi>not always the wealthieſt,</hi> but the contray. For when the Al-wiſe <hi>God</hi> does fore-ſee, that men will ſerve him as the <hi>prodigal ſon</hi> ſerved his <hi>father:</hi> who only prayed until he had got his patrimony, and then forſook him and ſpent the ſame in riot, to the givers diſhonour: even as the <hi>cloud</hi> that is
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:169975:4"/>lifted up, &amp; advanced by the <hi>Sun,</hi> obſcures the Sun: in this caſe he either denies them riches in mercy, as he denied S. <hi>Paul</hi> in his ſuit, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.8, 9. and our <hi>Saviour</hi> himſelf, <hi>Mat.</hi> 26.39. or grants them their riches in wroth, as he did a <hi>King</hi> to the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> Hoſea 13.11. and <hi>Quails wherewith he fed their bodies, but withall ſending leanneſſe into their ſouls,</hi> Pſal. 106.15.</p>
               <p>Firſt, that the beſt whom <hi>God</hi> loves moſt, are not alwayes the wealthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt: appears by a multitude of examples, together with plentiful expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience. It is recorded that the <hi>Mother of Chriſt</hi> at her <hi>Purification;</hi> was not rich enough to bring <hi>a Lambe for her Offering. Job</hi> from <hi>rich</hi> became <hi>poor</hi> to a Proverb. <hi>David</hi> even after he was anointed <hi>King;</hi> was put to many a hard ſhift even for victuals, which made him ſend to <hi>Nabal</hi> for relief. <hi>Chriſt</hi> himſelf had not <hi>twenty pence</hi> to pay <hi>tribute,</hi> untill he had borrowed it of the <hi>fiſh.</hi> No he had not ſo much <hi>as a houſe to dwell in,</hi> or <hi>a pillow</hi> of his own <hi>to ſleep on,</hi> as himſelf profeſſeth, <hi>Luke</hi> 9.57, 58. <hi>Ioſeph</hi> was forced to ſerve and aft<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> to become under-keeper of a <hi>priſon. Ruth</hi> was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell'd to <hi>glean,</hi> to keep her ſelf and her <hi>mother Naomy,</hi> from ſtarving; <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarus</hi> was driven to beg of the <hi>Rich Glutton.</hi> And many the like mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in the eleventh to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> and more in <hi>Eccleſiaſtical Hiſtory</hi> of the <hi>Primative Chriſtians,</hi> under the <hi>perſecuting Emperours. They were poor in this world, that they might he rich in faith: and heirs of the Kingdom, which God hath promiſed to them that love him,</hi> James 2.5.</p>
               <p>Secondly, &amp; ſo on the contrary: <hi>God</hi> not ſeldom gives moſt wealth to thoſe that are worſt: and to whom he loves leaſt. Yea, he hath alwayes for the moſt part; planted moſt wealth and riches, where he hath reaped leaſt fruit of graceful actions. <hi>The Tabernacles of robbers do prosper, and thoſe are in ſafety that provoke God, whom God hath enriched with his hand,</hi> Job 12.6. <hi>The wicked live and wax old, and grow in wealth; their ſeed is eſtabliſhed in their ſight, their houſes are peaceable without fear; and the rod of God is not upon them, their bullock genderth and faileth not, their Cow calveth, and caſteth not her Calf; There are no bonds in their death, but their ſtrength is firm, they are not in trouble as other men, neither are they plagued like other men, their eyes ſtand out with fatneſſe: they have more then heart can wiſh. They take the Tabret and Harp, and rejoyce at the ſound of the Organ: they ſpend their dayes in wealth, and in a moment they go down into bell,</hi> with a great deal more to like purpoſe, as you may read. <hi>Iob</hi> 21.13. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 73.3. to 21.</p>
               <p>To which I might adde a world of <hi>examples:</hi> The <hi>Cananites</hi> had the only fruitful land in the world; <hi>it flowed with milk and honey:</hi> yet the <hi>Lord</hi> loved them never the better, but when he ſaw good, he caſt them out. So now the <hi>Turk,</hi> and the <hi>King of Perſia,</hi> profeſt enemies to <hi>Chriſt;</hi> have the primeſt <hi>Principalities</hi> in all the world. Even <hi>bloody Haman,</hi> the worſt enemy that ever <hi>God</hi> and his <hi>Church</hi> had; abounded with wealth, and honour for a long time; yea, his command reached almoſt to <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven:</hi>
                  <pb n="6" facs="tcp:169975:5"/>yet all ended in <hi>ſhame, beggery</hi> and <hi>confuſion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Briefly, <hi>Laban,</hi> and <hi>Nabal,</hi> and <hi>Eſau,</hi> with moſt of the <hi>Kings of Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael and Judah;</hi> of whom few were good, (as it hath fared with the moſt and greateſt <hi>Potentates of the world</hi> ever ſince) likewiſe the <hi>Rich Fool</hi> in the <hi>Gospel,</hi> and the <hi>Rich Glutton,</hi> and the <hi>Rich man</hi> that turned his back upon <hi>Chriſt,</hi> when he was willed to <hi>ſell all, and give to the poor,</hi> Mark 10.21, 22. all theſe had wealth, riches, and honour in abundance: yet <hi>God</hi> loved them never the better, bad they were, and proſperity did more mar then mend them. He was not the beſt <hi>Diſciple</hi> that <hi>carried the bag: Chriſt</hi> committed his <hi>purſe</hi> to <hi>Iudas,</hi> wheras he gave his <hi>holy Spirit</hi> to his <hi>faithful Apoſtles;</hi> had not he been a wiſe <hi>Diſciple</hi> that ſhould have envied this great favour done to <hi>Iudas?</hi> and have ſtomached his own mean conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. So fooliſh are they, who (meaſuring Gods affection by temporal be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits) are ready to applaud proſpering wickedneſs, and to grudge out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward bleſſings to them, that are uncapable of any better. Nevertheleſs, as that Fool <hi>Haman</hi> deceived himſelf in conſtruing the <hi>Queens invitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> of him to the <hi>Banquet;</hi> as a matter of eſpecial grace, when indeed ſhe did it only to accuſe him, <hi>Eſter</hi> 5.12. <hi>&amp;</hi> 7.2, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſo men flatter themſelves, and think it a matter of ſpecial grace and favour; when God gives them abundance of theſe outward things: and hereupon they grow proud; when he not ſeldom gives them theſe things, as <hi>Jael</hi> gave <hi>Siſera milk and lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> Judg. 5.25, 26. Or as <hi>Ebud</hi> gave that preſent to <hi>Eglon,</hi> Judges 3.17, 21. For unleſs his bleſſing, and ſpecial grace go along with it: there is not a more compendious way to alienate a mans heart from God, then to wallow in worldly wealth, as the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> in ſundry places obſerves. See <hi>Pſal.</hi> 73.3, to 21. <hi>Iob</hi> 21.13. <hi>The wickeds table</hi> [though ſwimming never ſo much with dainties] <hi>is their ſnare, and their prosperity their ruine.</hi>

               <p>Wherefore prize not thy ſelf by <hi>what thou haſt,</hi> but by <hi>what thou art:</hi> for he that makes a <hi>bridge</hi> of his own <hi>ſhadow,</hi> cannot but <hi>fall into the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</hi> Yea, it behoves every wiſeman, to imitate the <hi>Deer:</hi> who is ever moſt fearful, at her beſt <hi>feeding.</hi> And indeed why ſhould any man think him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf better, for what he hath? when the <hi>Devil</hi> offered <hi>our Saviour, all the earth to worſhip him,</hi> Matth. 4.8, 9.</p>

<pb n="8" facs="tcp:169975:6"/>Commandements, and upon their ſeed,</hi> as I could plentifully, and moſt ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily prove, would time and place permit. So that what is ſpoken of <hi>Melte,</hi> a <hi>Tree in Mexico:</hi> namely, that it ſerves for <hi>weapons, needle, thrid, ſugar, honey, balme, ſueker, wine, cords, parchment, linnen, perfume, apparel,</hi> that it <hi>cures the ſtinging of Serpents,</hi> and the <hi>French Diſeaſe,</hi> with its very a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhes; and many the like, is more true of <hi>grace and holineſs:</hi> yea, as if it had a kinde of almightineſs in it, it can do all things, as might be fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhewen of <hi>faith</hi> and <hi>prayer,</hi> in the Servants of <hi>God,</hi> recorded in Scripture. Yea, which is more then all, <hi>faith and prayer</hi> can even <hi>binde the hands of the Almighty:</hi> as in the caſe of <hi>Moſes</hi> praying and prevailing for the <hi>Iſraelices, Exod.</hi> 32.10, 14. Nor is all this, that <hi>God</hi> hath promiſed to thoſe that ſerve him, ſo great a matter comparatively; as that we need wonder at it, or once queſtion the ſame: For <hi>if he ſpared not his own Son, but delivered him to death for us; how ſhall he not with him freely, give us all things alſo?</hi> Rom. 8.31, 32. It is the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> argument. Great, yea, too great things are they for us to receive; but not too great, for the great and good <hi>God of Heaven and carth</hi> to give: all the fear is on our part, whether we be ſuch to whom the promiſe is made. For all <hi>Gods promiſes are conditional</hi> And though of theſe outward good things, he hath promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed abundance: yet it is upon the condition of <hi>faith</hi> and <hi>obedience:</hi> as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears by all the fore-mentioned places; ſo that if we be not wanting in our duty, and obedience to <hi>God; God</hi> will not be wanting in any good thing to us: Not can we look that <hi>God</hi> ſhould make good his promiſes, if we make them void, by not obſerving the condition, as that we may do by our diſturſting him. If we will not dare to truſt <hi>God</hi> upon his promiſe ſo confidently as we would a friend, or ſome great man that is able and honeſt.</p>
               <p>Beſides, the <hi>Lord</hi> hath promiſed, that <hi>there ſhall be no want to them that fear him; and that no good thing will be with-hold, from them that walk uprightly,</hi> Pſal. 34.9. &amp; 84.11. where obſerve two things, there ſhall be no want to ſuch, and ſuch ſhall want no good thing: ſo that he muſt be ſuch an one, to whom the promiſe is made; and he muſt alſo be ſure, that it is good for him, which is promiſed. But oftentimes it is not good, for a man to abound with earthly bleſſings: as <hi>ſtrong drink</hi> is not good for <hi>weak brains.</hi> Yea, if any thing be wanting to a good man, he may be ſure it is not good for him: and then better that he doth want it, then that he did enjoy it, and what wiſe man will complain of the want of that, which if he had, would prove more hurtful then gainful to him? as <hi>a ſword</hi> to a <hi>mad man,</hi> a <hi>knife</hi> to a <hi>childe, drink</hi> to them that have a <hi>Fevour,</hi> or the <hi>Dropſie. No good thing will God with-hold, &amp;c.</hi> and therefore not wants themſelves, which to many are alſo good, yea, very good things, as I could reckon up many: want ſanctified, is a notable means to <hi>bring to repentance,</hi> to <hi>work</hi> in us <hi>amendment of life, it ſtirs up to prayer, it weans
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:169975:6"/>from the love of the world, it keeps us always prepared for the ſpiritual com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate, diſcovers whether we be true believers or hypocrites, prevents greater evils of ſin and puniſhment to come; It makes us humble, conformable to Chriſt our head, increaſeth our faith, our joy and thankfulneſs, our ſpiritual wiſdom,</hi> and likewiſe <hi>our patience,</hi> as I have largely ſhewen in another Treatiſe.</p>
               <p>To conclude, All <hi>good things</hi> were created for <hi>the good,</hi> and therefore are they called <hi>goods;</hi> becauſe the <hi>good God</hi> created them for <hi>good men, to do good withall.</hi> Therefore, as Jacob <hi>got the bleſſing,</hi> ſo he gate the <hi>inheritance</hi> alſo: to ſhew that as the faithful have the <hi>inward bleſſing,</hi> ſo they have the <hi>outward bleſſing</hi> too; when they will do them good, and cauſe them to do good. Yea, in this caſe, even as the <hi>ſheaffs</hi> fell before <hi>Ruth:</hi> ſo riches ſhall fall in our way, as they did to <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Lot,</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> and <hi>Job,</hi> and <hi>Joſeph,</hi> upon whom riches were caſt they knew not how; but as if <hi>God</hi> had onely ſaid, be rich; and they were rich ſtraight. But that this is the true and only way to wealth and happineſſe, needs no more proof then that which is recorded of <hi>Solomon,</hi> 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 3. 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 1. where the <hi>Lord appearing to him in a dream,</hi> ſaid, Ask, <hi>what I ſhall give thee?</hi> And he asking only <hi>an underſtanding heart, to diſcern between good and evil; that he might the better diſcharge that great place, whereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God had called him;</hi> wherein <hi>Gods glory,</hi> and the <hi>peoples good,</hi> was his <hi>principal aime</hi> and end: Heare what the <hi>Lords</hi> anſwer is. <hi>Becauſe this was in thine heart, and thou hast not asked riches, wealth or honour, nor the life of thine enemies, neither yet haſt asked long life, but haſt asked wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and knowledge for thy ſelf, that thou mighteſt judge my people, over whom I have made thee King: Wiſdom and knowledge is granted unto thee; and I will give thee riches, &amp; wealth and honour, ſuch as none of the Kings have had that have been before thee, neither ſhall there any after thee have the like, &amp;c.</hi> 2 Chron. 1.7. to 13, 14, 15.

For our heavenly Father, who knowes us better then we know our ſelves; and what is good and fit for us, (even as the <hi>Nurſe</hi> knowes better then the <hi>Childe,</hi> and the <hi>Phifician</hi> better then the <hi>Patient</hi>) knowes too well, how apt we are; to abuſe theſe his mercies, and that we cannot abound with earthly bleſſings, but we grow proud and ſurfet of them; a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p> The <hi>firſt</hi> particular, that requires to be taken up and viewed is, <hi>the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity</hi> of this duty.</p>
               <p>Now that to give to thoſe that are in want, and to help and relieve thoſe that are in miſery and diſtreſſe; is a duty enjoyned, and not left to us as a thing arbitrary and indifferent, appears in many particulars.</p>
               <p>Firſt, theſe <hi>works of mercy,</hi> are abſolutely required; and <hi>ſtraightly enjoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Law of God;</hi> which is the rule of righteouſneſſe, and with great earneſtneſſe <hi>preſſed</hi> and urged <hi>in the Gospel;</hi> as the fruits of our faith, and teſtimonies of our love to <hi>God,</hi> and <hi>our neighbour.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Precepts out of the <hi>Old Teſtament,</hi> enjoyning the ſame, are ſuch as theſe. <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord; Deal thy bread to the hungry, leave for the poor, that he may eat. Bring the poor that are caſt out into thine houſe, when thou ſeeſt the naked, ſee that thou cover him; and that thou hide not thy ſelf from thine own fleſh. If thine enemy hunger, give him bread to eat: and if he thirſt, give him water to drink. Thou ſhall not harden thine heart, nor ſhut thine hand from thy poor brother: yea, though he be a ſtranger, or a ſojour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>, but thou ſhalt open thy hand wide unto him, and ſhalt ſurely give or lend unto him ſufficient for his need in that which he wanteth, that he may live with thee. Beware that there be not a thought in thy wicked heart, or that thine eye be evil againſt thy poor brother, and thou giveſt him nought, and he cry unto the Lord againſt thee: thou ſhalt ſurely give him, and thy heart ſhall not be grieved when thou giveſt unto him,</hi> Deut. 15.7.10, to 16. Levit. 19.10. &amp; 23.22, &amp; 25: 35. Iſai. 58.6, 7. Prov. 25.21. with many ſuch places.</p>
               <p>And the like in the <hi>New Teſtament,</hi> as <hi>Give to him that asketh thee, and from him that would borrow of thee, turn not thou away. Give alms of ſuch things as ye have, &amp;c. He that hath two coats, let him impart to him that hath none: and he that hath meat, let him do likewiſe. If thine enemy hunger, feed him, &amp;c. Thou ſhalt love thy neighbour as thy ſelf. See that yee abound in this grace, alſo:</hi> namely, in a liberal contribution towards the poor, <hi>Luke</hi> 3.11. &amp; 6.34. &amp; 11.41. <hi>Rom.</hi> 12, 20. <hi>Matth.</hi> 5.42. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.7. to which I might adde plenty; for <hi>the Scriptures</hi> no leſſe <hi>abound in precepts</hi> of this nature; then <hi>ſilver</hi> did <hi>in the dayes of</hi> Solomon.</p>
               <p>Yea, this duty is charged upon us with ſuch ſtrictneſſe: that if we have not any thing to beſtow, we muſt <hi>by our labour get ſomewhat to give,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to our poor brethren; whereby they may be relieved in their neceſſities. And if we have no ſuperfluity, we are charged (if their wants be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream) <hi>to ſell our goods, and poſſeſſions; that we may have to give unto them,</hi> Luke 12.33. As we ſee it alſo <hi>practiſed in the Primitive Church,</hi> Acts 4.34.</p>
               <p>Now hath <hi>God</hi> ſo ſtrictly commanded this duty; and ſhall not we make conſcience thereof. The <hi>Lord</hi> by <hi>Moſes,</hi> but <hi>ſpake to the Rock, and it gave water to the thirſty Iſraelites:</hi> he but <hi>commanded the cloudes to rain down Manna,</hi> and <hi>the winde to bring them in
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:169975:8"/>Quails,</hi> for the ſatisfying of their hunger; <hi>and they did ſo.</hi> Yea, he but bade the <hi>Ravens bring bread, and fleſh to</hi> Elijah; and they did it. And ſhall we be harder then <hi>Rocks?</hi> more inſenſible and rebellious then the <hi>ſenſleſs Clouds?</hi> more inhumane then the <hi>Ravenous fowls?</hi> Certainly, they that obey not the voice of their Maker, and Redeemer: are more ſtubborn then the very <hi>Winde and Sea,</hi> Matth. 8.27. Worſe then <hi>Lions,</hi> Dan. 6.22. Or <hi>Bears,</hi> 2 Kings 2.24. Yea, leſſe compaſſionate then <hi>fire it ſelf,</hi> Dan. 3.27. Again, Is it not <hi>he</hi> (as <hi>Hannah</hi> ſpeaks) <hi>that maketh poor, and maketh rich? that bringeth low, and lifteth up? that raiſeth the poor from the dunghil, to ſet them among Princes? and maketh them to inherit the throne of glory.</hi> Do we enjoy all things through <hi>Gods</hi> bleſſing? and can we think to keep our riches by diſobeying his Commandements?

                  <hi>SEcondly,</hi> God hath not only commanded it but ſo, that without it there is no being ſaved. <hi>There needs no other reaſon of our laſt, and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vieſt doom; then ye have not given, ye have not viſited.</hi> For at the <hi>great and dreadful day of judgement,</hi> the upſhot of all, or main point which <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſhall ſcan will be: you have, or you have not ſhewed mercy to his poor members, <hi>Matth.</hi> 25.35, 36, 42, 43. Mark it, I pray you; for ſo does the reward of everlaſting happineſſe, through the free grace and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of <hi>God</hi> belong to theſe works of mercy; that the doing, or neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting them, is accompanied with <hi>eternal bleſſedneſſe, or endleſs miſery:</hi> for the ſentence of abſolution; or condemnation ſhall be pronounced either for, or againſt us, accordingly as we have performed, or omitted them. <hi>To thoſe that have fed the hungry, cloathed the naked, viſited the ſick, &amp;c. Come ye bleſſed of my Father, inherit the Kingdom prepared for you, from the foundation of the world:</hi> and contrariwiſe, <hi>to thoſe that have not done theſe works of mercy, Depart from me ye curſed, into ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting fire prepared for the Devil and his angels.</hi> But for the further con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming of this; hear how terrible Saint <hi>James</hi> the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> of mercy is, to thoſe <hi>Monſters</hi> among men, that live <hi>without bowels,</hi> James 2.13. <hi>There ſhall be judgement without mercy, to him that ſhews no mercy.</hi> To which may be added that of our <hi>Saviour with the ſame meaſure that ye mete with all, it ſhall be meaſured to you again.</hi> Luk. 6.38. And that of the Wiſe man, <hi>Who ſo ſtoppeth his cares at the cry of the poor: he alſo ſhall cry himſelf, but ſhall not be heard,</hi> Prov. 21.13. In vain they cry to us for charity, and for mercy we ſhall cry in vain to <hi>God.</hi> Thou haſt not been merciful, ſayes <hi>Baſil,</hi> and thou ſhalt not finde any: thou haſt not opened thy gates to the poor, and Heaven gates ſhall be ſhut againſt thee: thou haſt not gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven them a morſel of bread, and the bread of life ſhall be denied thee. But to add weight to the former Scriptures. Our Saviour hath given ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral imſtances, that we may the rather lay it to heart. <hi>Dives</hi> would not give <hi>Lazarus</hi> a <hi>crum of bread</hi> here, to aſſwage the pinching hunger of his
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:169975:8"/>body: therefore <hi>Lazarus</hi> ſhall not give <hi>Dives a drop of water</hi> hereafter to quench the thirſt, and cool the heat of his ſcorching ſoul. And the like in that <hi>cruel ſervant,</hi> Matth. 18. who <hi>for want of ſhewing mercy to his fellow, as his Lord had done to him; was delivered to the tormentors, and caſt into hell: Verſe</hi> 28. to the end of the Chapter, which I would wiſh all cruel and unmerciful men to read, and lay to heart; if ever they look to be ſaved. As take notice, I beſeech you, and for ever remember; that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though his <hi>Lord</hi> had immediately before been moved with compaſſion to looſe him, and forgive him the whole debt: yet now he hath <hi>his pardon cancelled, becauſe he would not ſhew mercy, as he had found mercy;</hi> this new ſin of his called all the reſt to rememberance. O that all cruel, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merciful <hi>Naballs</hi> would hear, believe and lay this to heart, before they feel the truth of it, in thoſe everlaſting flames with <hi>Dives</hi> and that <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thankful and unmerciful ſervant.</hi> And certainly, were not men <hi>ſtark mad,</hi> or at leaſt <hi>dead drunk with the love of their money:</hi> the very conſideration of this alone, would be a ſufficient motive to ſtir them up, to the doing of theſe good works, though there were no other reaſon: for if we either <hi>love Heaven,</hi> or <hi>fear Hell;</hi> if we would be <hi>everlaſtingly rewarded,</hi> or would not be <hi>everlaſtingly puniſhed and tormented;</hi> If we deſire with un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakable conſidence and joy, to appear before our gracious <hi>Saviour,</hi> and to our ineſtimable comfort, hear that bleſſed ſentence, or would not be aſtoniſhed and perplexed with that horrour and guilt, which ſhall make us to <hi>cry out to the Hills and Rocks to fall down and cover us, from the preſence of our terrible Judge:</hi> we will ſpare ſome thing from our ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluities; yea, if need require, even from our neceſſaries, that we may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve and cheriſh the poor diſtreſſed members of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And thus we ſee that unmerciful men ſhall be caſt into Hell, not only for hurting the poor, but for not helping them: not for taking away their bread, drink, &amp; cloaths; but for not giving theſe things unto them, which ſhews what a few, what a very ſmall number of them that call themſelve: <hi>Chriſtians</hi> ſhall go to <hi>Heaven,</hi> according to thoſe <hi>ſad Predictions,</hi> Matth 7.13, 14.

But if contrariwiſe we neglect thoſe charita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble uſes, which our Lord hath enjoyned us, and neglecting the poor, do ſpend our Maſters goods in exceſs and riot; if then, <hi>inſtead of feeding the hungry, and clothing the naked, we bring in account ſo much ſpent in dainty fare and gorgeous apparel, ſo much in ſtately buildings, and coſtly furniture, ſo much in rich jewels and needleſs vanities, ſo much laid out on Hounds; Horſes, Hawks, and Harlots, ſo much conſumed in gaming and revelling, in Playes and Interludes, ſo much ſpent in needleſs Suits of Law, in giving bribes; and entertaining rich friends; and in a word ſo much prodigally, fooliſhly, and wickedly waſted in the pleaſures of ſin, and voluptuous de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights; or ſo much miſer-like hoorded up and hid in a napkin: then ſhall we hear that fearful ſentence, which will make our hearts to ake, and our joynts to tremble: Thou wicked and ſlothful ſervant, thou ſaidſt, thou kneweſt that I reap where I ſowed not, and gather where I have not ſtrew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; thou oughteſt therefore to have put my money to the Exchangers, that then at my comming I ſhould have received mine own with advantage; take therefore the talent from him, and give it unto him that hath two talents, and caſt ye the unprofitable ſervant into utter darkneſs, there ſhall be weep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and gnaſhing of teeth,</hi> Matth. 25, 26, 27, to 31.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And certainly, we muſt unreaſon our ſelves, before we can think that God hath cauſed this inequality of eſtate amongſt men: becauſe he respect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the rich, and neglecteth the poor: and would have them pampered with
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:169975:10"/>all ſuperfluities, and delicious dainties; and the other ſtarved with want and penury: but hereby he would exerciſe the divers graces which he hath given to his Church and people: as namely, the charity, liberality, and fideli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the rich in diſpenſing of his talents; and the faith, affiance, and patience of the poor; that being approved, both might be crowned at the day of Chriſts appearing,</hi> according to that of <hi>Baſil,</hi> Why, ſaith he, do'ſt thou abound with riches? and he want neceſſaries? Surely that thou mighteſt receive the reward of thy faithful diſpenſation, and he alſo after many conflicts and victories, might have the reward and crown of his patience.</p>
               <p>The <hi>wealth of the rich,</hi> is given them to <hi>ſupply the neceſſities of the poor; as the wealth of the ſeven plentiful yeers, ſupplied the want of the ſeven barren. Our cups run over with</hi> Davids, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 23.5. and why <hi>run over?</hi> but <hi>that they may run into others empty veſſels;</hi> that the poor may partake of our redundancies. <hi>He giveth us all things richly; and this is to enjoy, not to hoord, much leſs to waſte.</hi> Is it fit that <hi>ſome</hi> ſhould be <hi>hungry in Gods Houſe, and others drunk,</hi> as at <hi>Corinth,</hi> 1 Cor. 11.11. and not <hi>rather that our abundance ſhould be a ſupply of others wants: that there may be equality,</hi> 2 Cor. 8.10, 14. As in the caſe of <hi>Manna,</hi> which <hi>was a type of this; The Lord</hi> would not allow that <hi>thoſe who had gathered much, ſhould keep and hoord up their ſuper fluity:</hi> but he enjoyned them to communicate of their greater ſtore to them who had gathered leſſe, the which the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle</hi> applyeth to the giving of almes out of our abundance, to thoſe that want, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.14. <hi>That now at this time your abundance may be a ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply for their want, that their aboundance might be a ſupply for your want, that there be equality, as it is written: he that gathered much had nothing over, and he that gathered little had no lack.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And thus you ſee, that <hi>juſtice bindes us to give almes, becauſe we are not the abſolute owners, but only Stewards of Gods gifts:</hi> for <hi>it is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of a Steward that he be found faithful,</hi> in laying out to every one, according to the minde and will of his Lord and Maſter.

To which accords that of <hi>Baſil;</hi> It is <hi>the bread</hi> of the hungry which mouldeth in thy cubbord, it is <hi>the Coat</hi> of the naked, which hangeth uſeleſſe in thy Chamber or Wardrobe; they are <hi>the Shoes</hi> of him that goeth barefoot, which lie rotting by thee; it is <hi>the ſilver of the needy,</hi> which ruſteth in thy Cheſts: and ſo many thou doſt injury, as thou canſt and do'ſt not relieve in their wants and miſeries. Yea, <hi>Ambroſe</hi> ſaith ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly, That it is alike faulty and blame-worthy; to take from the right Owners, and to deny neceſſaries to the poor; when we have abundance. And therefore know, ſaith he, That thou ſpoileſt ſo many of their goods, as thou denieſt relief unto when thou art able to give it. In which regard, the Apoſtle <hi>James</hi> ſpeaketh thus unto rich men; who neglect this duty: <hi>Go to now ye rich men, weep and howl for your miſeries that ſhall come upon you. Your riches are corrupted, and your garments moath-eaten: Your gold and ſilver is cankered, and the ruſt of them ſhall be a witneſſe againſt you, and ſhall eat your fleſh as it were fire: ye have heaped treaſure together for the laſt dayes,</hi> James 5.1, 2. But that of the <hi>Wiſe man,</hi> Prov. 3.27. is ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe, that there needs no more to prove it a duty. <hi>With-hold not good from them to whom it is due; when it is in the power of thine hand to do it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Wilt thou then be juſt, and pay every one his own; be ſure to give a conſiderable part of what thou haſt to the Poor: for they have a right to it, and as good a right as we have to the reſt: becauſe it is ratified and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lotted unto them by the ſame authority; as their portion, <hi>Leviticus</hi> 23.22. <hi>Deuteronomy</hi> 24.19, to 23. For if we have right to the main eſtate, becauſe <hi>God</hi> in his bounty hath given it unto us: then they have right alſo to the overplus which we may well ſpare, by vertue of the ſame donation. If <hi>we are but Stewards put in truſt by the owner of all things,</hi> who hath given or rather lent us the goods of this world, to the end we ſhould do good in this world: let us look to it that we faithfully diſcharge our truſt; that ſo we may have our <hi>quietus eſt,</hi> when we give up our accounts. For <hi>God</hi> will one day ſay unto the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merciful; Why did you not give things that were mine by right, yours on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by uſe and diſpenſation? whereof you were not Proprietaries and Lords, but accountant Stewards. And let all rich men look to it, for ſuch play the <hi>thieves;</hi> who having received much wealth from <hi>God,</hi> to this end, that they ſhould communicate the ſame for the relief of others, do appropriate it to their own uſe. For as the <hi>Steward of a Noble mans houſe,</hi> receiving great ſums yeerly of his Lord to this end, that he ſhould disburſe and lay it out for the keeping of his houſe, and maintenance of his family; ſhould therewith buy and purchaſe lands for himſelf, or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digally

               <p>BUt foraſmuch as men are rich or poor, not alone ſimply, but in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation unto others: a man is to be eſteemed rich, not only when he aboundeth with worldly wealth, but alſo when he is compared with one who is much poorer; and accordingly is to communicate of that which he hath, to the relief of thoſe who are in greater neceſſity. As for exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, he who is of a mean and poor eſtate: muſt give alms when he meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth with thoſe that are in greater need, and even thoſe that are in great need, muſt communicate ſuch as they have unto them, who are in extream
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:169975:13"/>neceſſity, and in danger preſently to periſh; unleſſe they have ſome help from others. Thus he that hath but a meer competencie, to ſupply the neceſſity of nature and eſtate: is to give ſomething out of it, to relieve thoſe who want neceſſaries belonging to nature: and thoſe who have only ſufficient for nature; are bound to give unto them, who are in great and preſent extremity: unleſſe the like neceſſity be imminent to them-themſelves. <hi>For the rule of juſtice and charity requiring; that we ſhould love our Neighbours as our ſelves, and do unto them as we would have them do unto us: Doth in the equity thereof require, that we prefer the life of our brethren, before our eſtate; and that we ſhould endure ſmall wants, to preſerve them from ſuffering thoſe which are great and dangerous.</hi> So that not only they who abound in riches, but even thoſe alſo who are of mean eſtate, are bound to perform this Chriſtian duty: as appears by the <hi>Prophet Elias:</hi> who required it of <hi>the poor Widow of Sarepta:</hi> and by the <hi>Apoſtle Saint Paul,</hi> who among the good works and qualities neceſſary to a widow, that would be maintained out of the Church-treaſury; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires this in expreſſe terms. <hi>If ſhe have lodged ſtrangers.</hi> And albeit he did know and acknowlege, that the <hi>Hebrews had been ſpoiled of their goods:</hi> yet nevertheleſſe he ſent them this exhortation; <hi>Be not forgetful to entertain ſtrangers, thereby ſhewing that poverty did not diſpenſe with them, or free them from the performance of this duty:</hi> but that they were ſtill as before obliged, to practiſe the ſame according to their preſent a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility. <hi>The deep poverty of the</hi> Macedonians <hi>kept them not from ſending to their power, yea, and beyond their power; a liberal and rich contribution to the poor Saints at</hi> Jeruſalem. And the <hi>Baptiſt requireth, that thoſe who have two coats part with one, and that they who have meat do likewiſe.</hi> That is, if he meet with thoſe that are in extream neceſſity; theſe things being not neceſſary, to the preſerving of his own life and eſtate: he does not ſay, he who hath but one coat, muſt leave himſelf naked, and give it to him that had none before: but <hi>he that hath two, not only, be that hath five or ſix, or half a ſcore, or one out of a whole Wardrobe: but one out of two.</hi> He that hath one more then his own need requireth. And our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour commandeth us, to <hi>give alms of ſuch things as we have: be they more or leſs, better or worſe,</hi> Luke 11.41. <hi>And if we have nothing to ſpare out of ſuperfluity: we muſt ſell that we have, and give alms in caſes of great neceſſity: and if we have nothing to ſell, we muſt work with our own hards, that we may have to give unto him that needeth,</hi> Epheſ. 4.28.</p>
               <p>An example hereof we have in the <hi>poor widow,</hi> which was ſo much commended by our <hi>Saviour Chriſt, for caſting into the treaſury her two mites, which was all her ſubstance,</hi> Mark 12.43. Here (as <hi>Angustine</hi> ſpeaks) was a very little <hi>money,</hi> but a <hi>great deal of charity.</hi> Likewiſe in the <hi>Apostles, who wanting ſilver and gold, gave ſuch as they had to the poor Criple;</hi> reſtoring him by miracle to the uſe of his limbs, that ſo by
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:169975:14"/>his labour, he might get his own living, <hi>Acts</hi> 3.6. And in our <hi>Saviour Chriſt</hi> himſelf, who though he were ſo poor, that he lived upon what o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers out of their love and duty miniſtred unto him, as appeareth, <hi>Luke</hi> 8.3. yet he himſelf gave alms to thoſe, who were in greater want; as we may gather, <hi>Iohn</hi> 12.6, 8. To which purpoſe, <hi>Ambroſe</hi> ſaith, That the commandement of mercy is common unto all Offices and degrees, neither is the <hi>Publican,</hi> or <hi>Souldier,</hi> the <hi>Husbandman,</hi> or <hi>Citizen,</hi> the <hi>Rich</hi> or <hi>Poor</hi> excepted: but <hi>all are to be admoniſhed, that they be ready to give unto him that needeth.</hi>

               <p>ANd therefore let none excuſe their neglect of this religious duty; becauſe their means is ſmall: but rather let this move them the more carefully to exerciſe it: as being in reſpect of them, an act <hi>not only of charity,</hi> but alſo of <hi>Chriſtian policie:</hi> ſeeing this is the means where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by being poor, they may become richer. For <hi>there is that ſcattereth, and is the more increaſed: and there is that ſpareth more then is meet; and commeth to poverty,</hi> Proverbs 11.24. And our <hi>Saviour promiſeth, that if we give, it ſhall be given to us again; good meaſure, preſſed down, and ſhaken toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and running over,</hi> Luke 6.38. Whence it is <hi>compared to ſowing of ſeed,</hi> 2 Cor. 9.6. <hi>and to trading.</hi> Luke 19.13. Now no man will in ſeed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time excuſe himſelf for not ſowing his ſeed; becauſe he hath but a ſmall quantity to ſpare, above that which he is to ſpend for his ſuſtenance that yeer: but this maketh him the rather to caſt it in to the ground; that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing multiplyed, he may have alſo enough the yeer following. <hi>There is none refuſe to trade, becauſe their ſtock is ſmall:</hi> but ſo much the more diligently they do it; that it may be increaſed. And <hi>therefore ſeeing almes giving, is our Chriſtian ſowing and trading: let not our ſmall means make us neglect it: but to practiſe it with more cheerfulneſs. And ſo much the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, becauſe we ſhall not only reap an earthly crop; but have alſo an heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly harveſt, which will never fail us, of which in the reaſons.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Neither let any man ſay, that this only belongeth unto thoſe who have much to give: for that their almes are ſo ſmall by reaſon of the meanneſſe of their eſtate, that they have no hope it will be reſpected: for the Lord ſaith not, Give much, but he commandeth to open the hand wide: whether it be great or little, and he meaſureth the deed by the will, and the outward act by the habit, and internal vertue: he looketh not ſo much, <hi>Quid datur,</hi> as <hi>ex quo:</hi> not to the greatneſſe of the gift, but to the quantity of the ſtore, out of which it is given, and the largeneſſe of the heart: which out of a little can ſpare ſomewhat. And therefore <hi>the affection of the giver, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth the almes precious</hi> and eſtimable, or <hi>vile</hi> and contemptible <hi>in Gods ſight</hi> in which reſpect no mans gift, as one ſaith, is accounted ſmall; who giveth it out of a great and liberal minde: ſeeing our piety is not to be
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:169975:14"/>meaſured by our outward wealth, but by the inward riches which lieth hid in the heart. It is true indeed, that rich men give greater gifts, and mean men leſſe, in reſpect of the matter or thing given: but there is no difference in the fruit of the work; where there is no want in the affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the workers. For as <hi>Ambroſe</hi> ſaith, It is the heart and minde of the giver, which maketh the gift rich or poor, and that ſets the price upon all theſe ſpiritual wares. An example whereof we have in <hi>the poor widow, who caſting into the treaſury two mites: was adjudged by our Saviour to have given the greateſt gift, becauſe ſhe had the largeſt, and moſt liberal heart;</hi> which made her to give (not like others, out of their ſuperfluity; but) even out of her penury all ſhe had: as alſo becauſe the rich giving out of their ſuperfluity; relie upon their own abundance, as ſufficient to bear them out in their bounty: whereas they who being poor, and yet give out of their penury; do in their almes-deeds (by a lively faith and affi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance) depend wholly upon <hi>Gods providence and promiſes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So that (as the Apoſtle ſpeaks) <hi>if there be firſt a willing minde: liberall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is accepted according to that a man hath, &amp; not according to that he hath not,</hi> 2 Cor. 8.12. As what was <hi>Rebekaes hoſpitality,</hi> ſo much extolled by <hi>Chryſoſtome?</hi> but water cheerfully afforded to <hi>Abrahams ſervant,</hi> for <hi>him and for his Camels:</hi> And what doth <hi>Chriſt</hi> require of them, that can give no more to his poor ſtrangers? but <hi>a cup of cold water only:</hi> proteſting with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, that if they give but ſo much, they ſhall in no wiſe loſe their reward, <hi>Matth.</hi> 10.42. <hi>If but water, but a cup of water; but a cup of cold water</hi> be not ſlighted: as a cold entertainment of a ſtranger; but be thought enough to make a poor man bountiful, even by the beſt prizer of all things and actions: who can exempt himſelf from this duty, under pretence of diſabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity. Is not <hi>water a cheap proviſion? a cup of water, a ſmall quantity? and a cup of cold water ſoon made ready? Let no man therefore (ſaith Saint</hi> Hierom <hi>here, and Saint</hi> Auguſtine <hi>elſwhere</hi>) <hi>plead poverty in this caſe:</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now what greater incouragement can there be, unto them that have little, to give ſomewhat of their ſmall ſtore, to thoſe that ſtand in need? ſeeing their work is as much eſteemed, and ſhall be as richly rewarded; as thoſe who give much out of their greater ſtore. (Yea, <hi>God will be ſure to increaſe that little we have: if we are willing to give of that little:</hi>) If a poor man had a gracious <hi>promiſe,</hi> from his Prince; that if he would lay out a few pence, at his appointment; he ſhould have a reward equal with his greateſt Nobles; who have in the ſame reſpect disburſed ſummes of great value: how readily would he part with his ſmall pittance? for the aſſuring of ſuch rich hopes. Or if a <hi>Merchant</hi> out of his love and boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; ſhould <hi>offer a precious jewel to ſale,</hi> ſetting his price not accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the ineſtimable value of the thing ſold; but according to the proportion of their ability who come to buy it, ſo that they who will give ſomewhat out of a little, ſhall aſſoon have it; as thoſe that will give much
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:169975:15"/>out of their rich eſtates: how would <hi>poor men crowde to</hi> come to <hi>ſuch a bargain?</hi> and with their ſpeed prevent the wealthy, in <hi>running to ſuch a market:</hi> but here is the like caſe! yea, ſo much better as <hi>heavenly jewels</hi> and rewards exceed thoſe which are <hi>earthly;</hi> and <hi>things permanent</hi> and <hi>everlaſting,</hi> excel in worth, thoſe which are <hi>mutable, and but of momenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny continuance.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Which being ſo, let none exempt themſelves from giving, that have wherewithall: and in caſe they have no better, let them afford <hi>courteous affability, and loving language,</hi> together with <hi>their prayers to God:</hi> which proceeding from the heart; is (as <hi>Auguſtine</hi> affirms) enough to make a poor man hoſpital in the ſight of <hi>God;</hi> and to procure for it a bleſſed reward.

               <p>In all our <hi>great feaſts,</hi> the gueſts which <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſpake for, are left out: <hi>He that is ready to fall, is as a Lamp despiſed in the opinion of the rich,</hi> Job. 12.5. But what ſaith <hi>Hierom?</hi> It is a kinde of <hi>ſacriledge,</hi> to give the goods of the poor, to ſuch as be rich enough: let the hungry bowels commend thy charity, not the paunches of thoſe that are almoſt burſten with abundance.

               <p>Wherefore, <hi>When thou makeſt a Dinner or a Supper, call not thy friends, nor thy brethren, neither thy kinsfolk, nor thy rich neighbours, leſt they alſo bid thee again, and recompence be made thee:</hi> Neither entertain merry com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions, paraſites, jeſters, or tellers of news; as is uſuall at great mens tables: for this is no charity or hoſpitality, though it be commonly graced with that title; but it is good fellowſhip, or ſome ſuch like thing as learned Expoſitors aver. It was the ſaying of an ancient <hi>Philoſopher,</hi> that the riches of many great Houſe-keepers are like <hi>Figs,</hi> growing on the brim of a deep downfal: for as <hi>Crows,</hi> and not <hi>men</hi> fare the better for theſe, ſo baſe fellows, and not worthy men have the benefit of thoſe.

               <p>ANd ſo I paſſe from the <hi>third</hi> general, <hi>viz. the perſons to whom</hi> we muſt give; to the <hi>fourth</hi> which is <hi>what we are to give.</hi> Wherein two things are chiefly conſiderable: the <hi>first</hi> is, that what we give muſt be <hi>our own,</hi> and the <hi>ſecond</hi> that it be <hi>worth the giving.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Firſt, let what thou giveſt be <hi>thine own goods, juſtly gotten;</hi> Zaccheus did not give until he had firſt <hi>restored.</hi> It is the <hi>chiefest charity, to do juſtice</hi> to every one: ſo reſembling <hi>Marcus Curius, a noble Romane,</hi> a man of ſingular wiſdom and honeſty: who having vanquiſhed the <hi>Samnites, Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bines,</hi> and <hi>King Pyrrhus;</hi> divided to every one of the people, <hi>fourty a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cres of land,</hi> and as much to himſelf and no more.</p>
               <p>None more charitable then <hi>Job,</hi> yet if he had not been <hi>an up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right and juſt man</hi> alſo, <hi>Job</hi> 1.8. his charity had never been eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of. For to <hi>rob ſome,</hi> and <hi>relieve others: is to offer unto God the hire of a whore, or the price of a dog,</hi> as the <hi>Scripture</hi> ſtiles it: both <hi>which are abomination to the Lord;</hi> Deut. 13.18. according to that, <hi>Proverbs</hi> 15.8. <hi>The ſacrifice of the wicked, is abomination unto the Lord.</hi> And <hi>God</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf profeſſeth, <hi>I the Lord love judgement, I hate robbery for a burnt-offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring,</hi> Iſa. 61.8. And as he hates it for a burnt-offering; ſo likewiſe for a work of mercy, <hi>Matth.</hi> 6.1. Yea, he that bringeth unto <hi>God,</hi> ſuch an <hi>alms</hi> or <hi>offering of the goods of the poor, doth as one that killeth the ſon, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the eyes of his father,</hi> as it is <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 34.20. Nor is it leſſe abominable and odious, or otherwiſe eſteemed of honeſt men. As when <hi>Henry the Third King of</hi> England; had ſent <hi>a load of Freeze</hi> to the <hi>Frier Minors,</hi> to cloath them: <hi>They returned the ſame again,</hi> with this meſſage; That he ought not to give alms of that, which had made ſo many poor, neither would they accept of that abominable gift! how much leſs then will the righteous <hi>God?</hi> Yea, this is ſo clear a caſe, that <hi>Selymus the Great Turk,</hi> could <hi>ſee it by the dim light of corrupt nature:</hi> For when upon his deathbed, he was moved by <hi>Pyrrhus</hi> that <hi>great Baſhaw;</hi> to beſtow that abundance of wealth, that he had wrongfully taken from the <hi>Perſian Merchants;</hi> upon ſome <hi>notable hospital</hi> for relief of the poor: he commanded it rather to be <hi>reſtored to the right owners,</hi> which was forthwith done accordingly. It was a brave reſolution in <hi>David:</hi> who when <hi>Araunah</hi> would needs have given him the <hi>threſhing-floor,</hi> anſwered; <hi>Not ſo: but I will buy it of thee at a price, and will not offer burnt-offerings unto the Lord my God, of that which coſt me nothing,</hi> 2 Sam. 14.24. And the ſame ſhould be every <hi>Chriſtians</hi> practice: For <hi>juſtice</hi> and <hi>mercy,</hi> muſt be <hi>matcht together,</hi> accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to that, <hi>Micah</hi> 6.8. <hi>Deal juſtly, and love mercy.</hi> And as <hi>mercy muſt lay out,</hi> that which is given to the poor: ſo <hi>juſtice muſt firſt bring it in.</hi>

               <p>The next thing to be conſidered in this partition, or diviſion; is the <hi>divers kindes of alms,</hi> the which are principally <hi>three: giving, forgiving, and free lending.</hi> But becauſe I intend only to ſpeak of the firſt of theſe,

                  <hi>Chriſtians</hi> muſt be given to hoſpitality; like <hi>Job, Abraham,</hi> and <hi>Lot:</hi> For as the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> exhorts the <hi>Theſſalonians</hi> to <hi>follow that which is good,</hi> and the <hi>Hebrews</hi> to <hi>follow peace with all men,</hi> and <hi>Timothy</hi> to <hi>follow af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter righteouſneſs,</hi> and the <hi>Corinthians to follow after charity:</hi> So doth he exhort the <hi>Romanes</hi> to <hi>follow after hospitality.</hi> Which vertue is alſo by St. <hi>Peter,</hi> commended to the believing <hi>Jews,</hi> and by St. <hi>John,</hi> commended to <hi>Gaius,</hi> and <hi>Demetrius;</hi> and the contrary vice blamed and reproved in <hi>Diotrephes,</hi> 3 <hi>John</hi> 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12.</p>

And indeed this is an Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection that I cannot tell how to ſhape an anſwer to it; ſave only that there are many <hi>profeſſors</hi> of religion, that are not <hi>poſſeſſors</hi> of it. They wear indeed <hi>Chriſts livery,</hi> but are none of his; neither do they
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:169975:22"/>know <hi>God,</hi> nor the power of <hi>Religion.</hi> For if they were indeed convert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and had the Spirit of <hi>Chriſt:</hi> they could not but be merciful and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beral, witneſſe <hi>Zaceheus,</hi> and they in the ſecond and fourth of the <hi>Acts.</hi> So far forth as we are godly, we are imitators of <hi>the godly nature.</hi> But in nothing do we more reſemble <hi>God,</hi> then when we are bountiful and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neficial to all that need our help. <hi>God delights in mercy more then in ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice,</hi> Hoſea 6.6. And a merciful man is ſtricken to the heart with the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries of others; and is compell'd to help them if he can. <hi>The power of religion and godlineſs lieth in the practice of it,</hi> James 1.22. <hi>By this ſhall all men know ye are my Diſciples, if ye love one another,</hi> John 13.35. <hi>Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one that loveth is born of God,</hi> 1 John 4.7.

               <p>Again, <hi>God</hi> whoſe our riches are (for only our ſins, can we challenge as our own) <hi>commands us</hi> to be pittiful and merciful, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.8. <hi>Luke</hi> 6.36. <hi>Micah</hi> 6.8. <hi>Chriſt was ſo,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.9. <hi>Iſai.</hi> 25.4. <hi>Matth.</hi> 15.32. <hi>Mark</hi> 8.2, 7. And his precept to all believers is, <hi>Learn of me,</hi> Matth. 11.29.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Believers did ſo,</hi> in all ages, <hi>Cornelius gave much alms to the poor,</hi> Acts 10.1, 2. <hi>Paul</hi> did ſo, Acts 24.17. <hi>Dorcas was full of good works and alms deeds which ſhe did,</hi> Acts 9.36, 39. <hi>The good woman in the</hi> Proverbs <hi>ſtretched out her hands to the poor and needy,</hi> Prov. 31.20. Job <hi>was a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to the poor,</hi> Job 29.16. &amp; 31.16, to 21. <hi>Zaccheus</hi> was a miſerable, wretched, and covetous extortioner: but when he was converted, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came as liberal. <hi>Half my goods I give to the poor,</hi> Luke 19.7, 8, 9. The <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Chriſtians ſold their poſſeſſions, and goods; and parted them to all men as every one had need,</hi> Acts 2.44, 45. &amp; 4.22, to 38. 2 Cor. 8.14, 15. The <hi>believing Corinthians were willing, even above their power,</hi> 2 Cor. 8.2, 3, 4. And the like of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and <hi>Lot,</hi> and <hi>Boaz,</hi> &amp; many others men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in <hi>the word.</hi> And indeed all that are truly converted &amp; godly. <hi>The righteous ſheweth mercy, and giveth,</hi> Mat. 5.7. Col. 3.12. Pſal. 37.21. So that if a man be uncharitable and unmerciful; he cannot be of the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the faithfin, however he may ſlatter himſelf. And indeed how are we like <hi>Chriſt</hi> and his people; if we have not the ſame minde, and ſpirit, and heart they had: if we walk not in their ſteps, and do not as they did? It was the very end why <hi>Christ gave himſelf for us; that he might redeem us from all iniquity, and purge us to be a peculiar people unto himſelf, zealous of good works,</hi> Titus 2.14. And therefore, <hi>If we have not given our bread to the hungry, and covered the naked with a garment; God</hi> will not own us, let our profeſſion be what it will, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 18.16. And no mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel, for if we be uncharitable, we obey not but flatly <hi>deny the Goſpel,</hi> 2 Cor. 9.13, 14. <hi>and ſhall be puniſhed with everlasting destruction from the preſence of the Lord,</hi> 2 Theſſ. 1.8, 9.</p>
               <p>Thus I might proceed &amp; make it alſo as plain: that he who hath no <hi>true charity,</hi> hath <hi>no true faith,</hi> no <hi>true wiſdom,</hi> no well grounded <hi>hope, peace of
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:169975:23"/>conſcience,</hi> or any other <hi>ſaving grace</hi> whatſoever. And that all <hi>ſuch a mans religion is vain,</hi> impure, falſe, hypocritical; where mercy to the poor is wanting as a companion: nor hath he any right or title to any of thoſe <hi>gracious promiſes,</hi> which are tendered by <hi>Christ</hi> in the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> but I think it fit, to preſume no further upon your patience. So having anſwered theſe <hi>two Objections,</hi> I proceed.</p>

               <p>IN the next place, look not alwayes to be ſolicited by thoſe that are in need, or by others in their behalf: The liberal man does daily ſeek out occaſion, to put his charity in practice. A man given to hoſpitali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, will not ſtay, till the needy obtrude themſelves upon him, and crave entertainment, but he will ſeek, and invite them as <hi>Abraham</hi> did. Nay, he will in a manner compell them, to enter into his houſe, if out of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſty and baſhfulneſs they do refuſe it. As <hi>Lot preſſed upon his gueſts greatly,</hi> and the <hi>Shunamite constrained</hi> Eliſha <hi>to eat bread in her houſe.</hi> Thus the <hi>faithful</hi> have done, not only when there were no Innes to receive and lodge ſtrangers; but alſo after Innes and Taverns were erected, as appears by the example of <hi>Lydia,</hi> who beſought and <hi>conſtrained</hi> Paul <hi>and his companions, to take lodging at her houſe,</hi> Acts 16.15. and of the two <hi>Diſciples going to</hi> Emmaus; who taking <hi>Chriſt</hi> for a ſtranger, <hi>conſtrained him to tarry with them that night,</hi> Luke 24.29.

And if this be omitted, the benefit loſeth ſome part of its grace: becauſe it is purchaſed with pain; and commeth not freely and without ſome coſt. <hi>Nam non tulit gratìs, qui cùm rogaſſet acce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pit.</hi> There is nothing dearer, then that which is bought with the price of many prayers, and the benefactour alſo loſeth ſome part of his thanks: for a <hi>benefit pierceth</hi> the heart <hi>like a dart,</hi> diverſly, in reſpect of the divers manner of caſting it: <hi>ſlighty</hi> if it be caſt <hi>faintly,</hi> and <hi>deeply</hi> when as it commeth <hi>forcibly,</hi> and with a good will.</p>

Contrary whereunto is the practice of many: who either like <hi>evil Nurſes,</hi> are ſo <hi>hard of milk;</hi> that it cannot be <hi>drawn</hi> from them without pain and irkſomneſs; the which they expreſſe by their ſoure looks, and wreathed and wrinkled foreheads: or elſe cover the poors nakedneſſe, and relieve their wants, as <hi>Noahs ſons</hi> (with a better minde) <hi>did cover the nakedneſs of their Father, with their faces turned</hi> another way.

               <p>A man would wonder to ſee how ſome men, out of a deſperate reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to give them nothing; will not ſo much as look upon their miſeries: leſt their <hi>conſcious eyes,</hi> ſhould <hi>check their churliſh hearts,</hi> and put them in minde of their <hi>barbarous inhumanity.</hi> But let ſuch be aſſured, that as they turn away their eyes from the poor, in the day of their miſery; ſo the Lord will turn away his face from them, in the day of their calamity: and <hi>as they have ſtopped their eares at the cry of the poor, ſo they themſelves ſhall cry, and God will not hear them:</hi> as it is, <hi>Prov.</hi> 21.13.</p>

And likewiſe in the <hi>Mace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donians,</hi> of whom the Apoſtle teſtifieth, that <hi>in communicating to the neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the Saints: they were to their power, yea, &amp; beyond their power willing of themſelves; praying them with much intreaty, that they would receive their gifts,</hi> 2 Cor. 8.2, 3, 4. It is not ſo now; yea, let men be prayed with much intreaty, they will not give: Yea, ſo contrary to this is the practice of many, that if they do give ſome ſmall relief; they will be ſure to <hi>joyn with their alms, proud and inſolent expoſtulations,</hi> harſh words, bitter and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braiding ſpeeches: feeding the poor, <hi>as they feed their untaught dogs;</hi> which they would have at command: for when they <hi>offer them meat,</hi> they do withall <hi>ſo ſneap and rebuke them;</hi> that they dare ſcarcely take it, but are ready to let it fall out of their hands and mouthes, for fear of beating. Now this turns a benefit into an injury: ſo that he doth not ſo much com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort the poor men by his gifts, as he doth vex and afflict his ſoul with his manner of giving, cauſing him in his heart to preferre a courteous refuſal before a grant that is ſo ſoure and churliſh. But you may uſually obſerve, that this inſulting <hi>arrogancie is a weed that ever grows on a dunghil;</hi> and that they are puft mindes and <hi>baſe ſpirits, that have</hi> thus <hi>to trample upon inferiours.</hi> Whereas <hi>miſery</hi> with good natures, is made a <hi>Loadſtone of mercy:</hi> it is contrarily made <hi>a footſtool for pride</hi> to trample on: and nothing ſo midnights the ſoul of him that is fallen; as ſcorn &amp; contempt: whence the <hi>Spaniards</hi> have their <hi>Proverb: In the houſe of one that was hanged, we ought not ſo much as to name a rope.</hi> It is no hard, nor unheard of thing; <hi>With a gift to purchaſe an enemy.

Wrongs</hi> pierce deeper then <hi>gifts;</hi> and the memory taketh faſter hold of them; when as it eaſily ſuffereth theſe to ſlip out. whence that <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 18.15. My ſon, blemiſh not thy good deeds, neither uſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comfortable words when thou giveſt any thing, <hi>Verſe</hi> 16.

A fool will upbraid churliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and a gift of the envious conſumeth the eyes: for as to ſhew ill looks, ſo to give ill words to gueſts or ſtrangers, is to <hi>give them good meat, and put pins therein.</hi>

                  <hi>SIxtly,</hi> the next point to be conſidered, is the <hi>quantity</hi> of our alms, &amp; <hi>how much</hi> we are to give: the which is not particularly determined in the <hi>Scriptures:</hi> becauſe there are ſo many circumſtances which alter the caſe, that <hi>no certain rule</hi> could be given: but it is left in ſome kinde to the diſcretion of the prudent <hi>Chriſtian;</hi> to give according to the occaſion offered more or leſſe, <hi>as he ſhall be perſwaded in his minde.</hi> And therefore the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> exhorting the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> to abound in this grace addeth; <hi>that he ſpeaketh not this by commandement, but by the occaſion of the forward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of others,</hi> 2 Cor. 8.7, 8. and afterwards, 2 Cor. 9.7. <hi>Every man accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as he purpoſeth in his heart, ſo let him give, not grudgingly, or of neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity, for God loveth a cheerful giver.</hi> And this the nature of the work re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth: for giving is a free and liberal action: and therefore is to be done freely, and willingly, and conſequently cannot be done by all in the like proportion: becauſe their hearts are not alike enlarged with love and bounty.</p>
               <p>But yet this in the general is required, that we give our alms not with a ſtrait and niggardly hand; but bountifully and largly: the which is implyed, by the Metaphor that the Scripture uſeth of <hi>ſcattering and ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>w<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſeed,</hi> fitted by the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> to this action of giving alms, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.6. which is uſually done with a bountiful and full hand, as alſo by that phraſe of <hi>opening the hand wide, to the poor</hi> and needy, <hi>Dent.</hi> 15.11. and of <hi>ſtretching and reaching out to the poor,</hi> which phraſe <hi>Solomon</hi> uſeth to expreſſe the bounty of <hi>the vertuous woman,</hi> Prov. 31.20. And in regard hereof, the act of giving alms is by the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> tearmed by the name of bounty, and oppoſed to covetouſneſſe, as being contrary unto it, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.5. And plainly expreſſed, where he perſwadeth to this bounty by annexing that gracious promiſe, 2 Cor. 9.6. <hi>He that ſoweth bountifully, ſhall reap bountifully,</hi> and maketh it to be an eſpecial <hi>grace of the Spirit,</hi> to abound in theſe works of mercy, <hi>Verſe</hi> 8. and an undoubted <hi>ſigne of the ſincerity of our love,</hi> 2 Cor. 8.8. Whence his advice to them is, <hi>As ye abound in everything, in faith, in word, and knowledge, and in all diligence, and in your love towards us: even ſo ſee that ye abound in this grace alſo,</hi> 2 Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinth. 8.7.</p>
               <p>Now he only is liberal and bountiful, who diſtributeth what he is able, and according <hi>as God hath enriched him,</hi> as the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> enjoyns, 1 Pet. 4.10. <hi>As every man hath received the gift, even ſo miniſter the ſame
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:169975:25"/>one to another; as good ſtewards of the manifold grace of God.</hi> Yea, &amp; that we may be the more able, and ſo the more bountiful and plentiful in good works: we are commanded to be careful &amp; diligent in <hi>preſerving</hi> and <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing</hi> of <hi>our eſtates,</hi> by all lawful means in <hi>acquiſition</hi> &amp; <hi>getting</hi> by our honeſt &amp; <hi>painful labour</hi> in our callings: and by our <hi>frug al husbanding, and thrifty ſpending of our goods;</hi> that ſo having greater plenty, we may be the richer in good works. Which being ſo, let every man I ſay, <hi>as God hath enabled him do good,</hi> and they <hi>more good then others,</hi> who have received <hi>more goods then others.</hi>

               <p>BUt becauſe this rule alſo may ſeem yet too general: for, that the quantity and proportion is not particularly ſet down; the beſt way will be to examine what others have done in this caſe: for where the Law written does fail, we ought to obſerve what hath been the practice of the godly, that have gone before us. To which end take theſe inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, <hi>Jacob</hi> thought he could not diſcharge his duty, nor expreſſe his thankfulneſſe to <hi>God</hi> this way; except he gave <hi>a tenth-part</hi> of his ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance: his vow is <hi>of all that thou ſhalt give me, I will ſurely give the tenth unto thee again, Gen.</hi> 28.22. and his <hi>hand,</hi> did ſecond his <hi>tongue. Zaccheus</hi> gave <hi>half he had to the poor,</hi> Luke 19.7, 8, 9. The <hi>Primitive Chriſtians exceeded him,</hi> Acts 2.44, 45. and 4.22. <hi>King Alfred</hi> the firſt <hi>King of the Anglo-Saxons;</hi> beſtowed the <hi>ſixth part</hi> of his riches and rents upon the poor ſtrangers of the Countrey; and ſent every yeer little leſſe to <hi>forreigne Caurches</hi> without the Realm. <hi>John of Alexandria,</hi> ſir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>named the <hi>Almoner,</hi> did uſe yearly to <hi>make even</hi> with his revenues, and when he had diſtributed all to the poor, he thanked <hi>God,</hi> that he had now nothing left him but his <hi>Lord and Maſter Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> to whom he longed to flie with unlimed and unintangled wings. The <hi>Lord Harrington</hi> gave <hi>the tenth</hi> of his allowance to the poor, and other good uſes; beſides, what he gave as he walked and travelled abroad; which was not ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom not little. Reverend Maſter <hi>Whateley</hi> Miniſter of <hi>Banbury,</hi> alſo gave <hi>the tenth</hi> both of his <hi>ſpiritual</hi> and <hi>temporal means;</hi> and was earneſt upon all occaſions (in private and publike) in preſſing this duty of liberality upon others. Biſhop <hi>Hooper</hi> at his houſe in <hi>Worceſter,</hi> had every day a great table full of poor people appointed by courſe; which he fed with wholeſome meat: who were firſt examined and inſtructed by himſelf, or others appointed by him in the chief principles of Religion. He was ſaid to be <hi>ſpare of diet, ſparer of words, ſpareſt of time,</hi> and only <hi>liberal</hi> in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving <hi>the poor. Queen Anne of Bullen,</hi> ever carried about her a purſe for the poor; as thinking no day well ſpent, wherein ſome had not fared the better for her: yea, ſhe kept her maids and ſuch as were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout her, always employed in ſewing and working garments for the poor: that there was neither time for idleneſſe, nor leiſure to follow fooliſh pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimes:

M. <hi>George wiſebeart a Scotch Martyr,</hi> to the end he might do the more good, forbore <hi>one meal in three, and one day in four,</hi> for the moſt part; except ſomething to comfort nature; and would lie upon ſtraw, in courſe new canvas ſheets; which when ever he changed, he gave away. <hi>Giles of Bruſſels Martyr, gave all he could poſſible ſpare,</hi> to refreſh ſome with <hi>meat,</hi> ſome with <hi>clothes,</hi> ſome with <hi>houſhold ſtuff;</hi> and withall did miniſter <hi>whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome exhortation and good inſtruction,</hi> to thoſe he relieved: and amongſt the reſt, one poor woman being brought to bed, wanting a bed; he ſent his own bed, lying himſelf in ſtraw. Yea, when he was in priſon he mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtred to the reſt of his fellow-priſoners the beſt of his fare; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented himſelf with the very courſeſt.

               <p>Many ſuch inſtances I could give you, of ſome that are dead, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers yet living; that give ſome <hi>a tenth part</hi> of what they are able to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend, others <hi>a fifth part,</hi> others, that had they a thouſand pounds a year, would let it all go in good uſes; others that refuſe to keep Coach, horſe or man, or to be atany needleſs expence; but live privately and ſparingly; that they may the better diſcharge their duty, in giving all they can ſpare to pious and charitable uſes: and are ſo far from thinking they deſerve by it, that they count themſelves <hi>moſt unprofitable ſervants.</hi> But it were unfit to name the living, and I am loath to exceed in examples recorded by others: Neither would you allow of it, if I ſhould be over-prolix. I wiſh men would learn by theſe examples, and be provoked to ſpare ſomething from their ſuperfluities, yea, if need require (as in theſe times there be millions in need enough) even from their neceſſaries; that the poor diſtreſſed members of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> might be relieved and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted more then they are with their <hi>ſix pence a week,</hi> which is but e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to keep a dog. Nor can I think any thing more diſhonourable to <hi>our Nation and Religion;</hi> then our unmerciful, and unchriſtian like pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion for the poor. And the time will come, that men will curſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, that they kept their Coaches, lived like Lords, <hi>got</hi> thouſands <hi>ill
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:169975:26"/>enough,</hi> and <hi>kept</hi> it <hi>as ill:</hi> in letting millions periſh or pine for want of neceſſaries. I believe, yea, I know (if the <hi>Word of God</hi> be true) that it had been better for them, to have afforded God his tithes, his <hi>ſubſidiae pro pauperibus;</hi> which is, as I ſuppoſe, a portion, that may well be ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of moſt men. And the <hi>Jews</hi> had the <hi>poor mans tithes,</hi> as well as the <hi>Levits.</hi> But they will heap up wealth, and purchaſe land, as if they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to ſhare the whole world amongſt ſome few; and the reſt were to be their vaſſals. But I fear they do not more <hi>heap up riches,</hi> then they <hi>heap up wrath to themſelves againſt the day of wrath;</hi> and that what St. <hi>James</hi> ſpeaks will be verified upon them, who ſaith, <hi>Go to now ye rich men, weep and howle for your miſeries that ſhall come upon you; your riches are corrupted, and your garments moth-eaten; Your gold and ſilver is can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kered, and the ruſt of them ſhall be a witneſs againſt you, and ſhall eat your fleſh as it were fire. Ye have heaped up treaſure together for the laſt dayes; Behold, that which is of you kept back from the poor, either by fraud or cruelty cryeth, and the cryes of them are entred into the eares of the Lord of Sabboth. Ye have lived in pleaſure on the earth, and been wanton; Ye have nouriſhed your hearts as in a day of ſlaughter, &amp;c.</hi> James 5.1, to 6.</p>
               <p>And whatever men deem, our own abundance can ill ſtand with our engagement to others that lack. It is great injuſtice for us to be full, when others pine. And let rich men look to it: for great abundance can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be both gathered and kept without a great deal of ſin, as <hi>Eraſmus</hi> obſerves. The poor are owners of our ſuperfluities, nor is it ſo much ours as theirs: yea, what is it other then <hi>a plauſible ſtealth?</hi> to feed our riot with the wants of the owners. Whence <hi>Laurentius</hi> is bold to affirm, That the <hi>rich</hi> offend more in not <hi>giving</hi> their <hi>ſuperfluities,</hi> then the <hi>poor</hi> do in <hi>ſtealing neceſſaries.</hi>

Notwithſtanding in caſes of urgent neceſſity &amp; great extremity: men are to ſtrain themſelvs, and to rack their eſtates above the reach of their ability; to preſerve their brethren, from being tortured in their perſons, upon the rack of neceſſity. For which the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> magnifieth the Chriſtian bounty of the <hi>Macedo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians:</hi> who <hi>even above their ability; contributed and communicated to the relief of the poor Saints.</hi> And this our <hi>Saviour</hi> requireth, <hi>Luke</hi> 12.33. <hi>Sell that you have, and give alms.</hi> If a man want money, yet if he have money-worth that he may ſpare, he muſt ſell and give; and in ſome ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes all, even a mans poſſeſſion, as they did in the beginning of the <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel,</hi> Acts 4.34. And <hi>John the Baptiſt,</hi> Luke 3.11. requireth that <hi>he who hath two coats, ſhould impart unto him that hath none: and that he who hath meat, ſhould do likewiſe.</hi> Whereby is meant, that he who hath more then is ſufficient for the ſuſtentation of life, muſt communicate it unto thoſe who are in extream neceſſity, and in iminent danger of periſhing, as we ſee it practiſed by the faithful in <hi>time of perſecution,</hi> Acts 2.45. where in a common calamity, <hi>They that had poſſeſſions and goods, ſold them, and parted them to all as every man had need.</hi> Otherwiſe, unleſſe it be in theſe caſes of extremity, it is lawful to poſſeſſe not only thoſe things which are neceſſary to nature, but alſo to a mans eſtate and perſon: For we read that <hi>Paul had a ſpare cloak at</hi> Troas, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.13. And that our <hi>Saviour</hi> himſelf <hi>had two coats</hi> in his greateſt perſecution, <hi>John</hi> 19.23.</p>
               <p>So that except it be in caſes of the greateſt neceſſity; we muſt obſerve a <hi>golden Mean.</hi> For we have not a <hi>ſea</hi> of ſufficiency, which cannot be drawn dry. No nor yet is our eſtate in it ſelf, <hi>a ſpringing fountain,</hi> which is no ſooner empty, but preſently it filleth again: but it is like <hi>a pool of ſtanding water,</hi> or as it were <hi>a ſmall ſtream,</hi> which is fed and ſupplied by the <hi>ſpring</hi> of <hi>Gods</hi> bounty, and therefore we muſt not let it flow out faſter then it commeth in, but ſtill preſerve the main ſtock, (unleſſe it be as hath been ſhewen in caſes of great neceſſity) and keep the pond in a convenient fulneſſe; letting the overplus continually run over to good uſes: for otherwiſe there will be an intermiſſion in the ſtream of our bounty; till the emptineſſe be repleniſhed; and <hi>too much at one time,</hi> will cauſe neceſſarily <hi>too little at another.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Wherefore, that we may conſtantly hold out in well doing unto the end: there is required that an equality and proportion be obſerved, in diſcreet fitting of our works of mercy and beneficence, unto our eſtate and ability; that they may match but not exceed it.</p>
               <p>The wiſe <hi>Husbandman,</hi> doth not caſt all his ſeed into the ground: but reſerveth ſo much at leaſt, as will be ſufficient to maintain his family; and ſo <hi>we muſt ſowe not all we have, but all which we can ſpare;</hi> that through out indiſcretion we want not food before the time of <hi>Harveſt.</hi>

               <p>It is Gods expreſſe command, <hi>Deut.</hi> 16. <hi>None ſhall appear before the Lord empty: every man ſhall give according to the gift of his hand, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the bleſſing of the Lord thy God which he hath given thee,</hi> Verſe 16, 17. <hi>Let every man,</hi> ſaith Saint <hi>Peter, as he hath received the gift; mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter the ſame one to another, as good dispoſers of the manifold grace of God,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.10.

                  <hi>Fifthly,</hi> How comes it that thou thinkeſt ſo much, but little enough for thy ſelf? is not this ſelf love only? For if thy great abundance be little enough for thee: canſt thou think ſo ſhort a pittance as thy brother hath, much enough for him?

It is expected the <hi>Lord</hi> will uſe him, to do great things for the good of this Nation: eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially to eaſe the oppreſſed, and to help thoſe that cannot help them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. The benefit and good whereof will (I preſume) more and more ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear; to the <hi>glory of God,</hi> and the <hi>welfare of this Nation,</hi> maugre all the peoples rage.</p>
               <p>But wo to thoſe mercileſſe men that do hinder! (as too many <hi>inſtead of helping</hi> the poor, do <hi>rob the poor.</hi> One, even a <hi>Juſtice of the Peace</hi> gave in his account of the poors money five hundred pounds ſhort, as can be proved; it were a good deed to name him, for example to others:) or that would not be ready to further ſuch a work. As, conſider (I beſeech you) what ought to be done in this caſe, what is our <hi>duty,</hi> and what will be our <hi>doom</hi> if we do not prevent it, by a timely <hi>breaking off our ſins by righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, and our iniquities by ſhewing more mercy to the poor,</hi> Dan. 4.27. of which Chriſt hath given us a fair warning beforehand, <hi>Matth.</hi> 25. from <hi>Verſe</hi> 41. to the end of the Chapter, which is a <hi>Book-caſe, plain, and eaſie</hi> for each of us to underſtand, that would not feel thoſe flames.</p>
               <p>It is not ſufficient to give the poor ſomething, unleſs they have ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient for their need. <hi>Thou ſhalt not harden thine heart, nor ſhut thine hand from thy poor brother: but thou ſhalt open thine hand wide unto him, and ſhalt ſurely lend him ſufficient for his need in that which he wanteth,</hi> Deut. 15, 7, 8. So <hi>they parted their goods to all men, as every one had need,</hi> Acts 2.44, 45. <hi>Neither was there any among them that lacked, diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bution was made, according as he had need,</hi> Acts 4.34, 35, 37. <hi>If ye give not thoſe things that are needful to the body: what doth it profit?</hi> James 2.16. 1 John 3.17. <hi>That their abundance might be a ſupply of their want: that
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:169975:29"/>there might be an equality,</hi> 2 Cor. 8.13, 14. I ſay not ſuch an equality, for every one to <hi>have,</hi> and <hi>wear,</hi> and <hi>fare alike:</hi> but that the neceſſities of every one, may be ſupplied. Yet it may be obſerved, that when <hi>God</hi> ſed his people in the <hi>Wilderneſs;</hi> there were among them <hi>Princes</hi> and <hi>Rulers: God</hi> could, but would not provide more, nor better for them then others, one meat for all. Alſo <hi>God</hi> preſcribed a like meaſure, an <hi>Homer</hi> for each man, the pooreſt had no leſſe, the richeſt had no more. What elſe doth it ſignifie to us? beſides his bounty; but this: that it is the will of <hi>God;</hi> that there ſhould not be ſuch an extream inequality of living among his people, <hi>Exod.</hi> 16.16, 17, 18. Alſo that we ſhould not think any thing too much, nor too good; for the meaneſt of the Saints: for <hi>Manna</hi> is called <hi>Angels food,</hi> and <hi>meat from Heaven.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But do we in any proportion what we ought? or what the former Scriptures enjoyn? As conſider, <hi>Pariſhes</hi> allow their poor, perhaps <hi>four pence</hi> a <hi>week for houſe-rent, a peny a week for apparel and houſhould-ſtuff, a peny a week for waſhing, a peny a week for firing, a peny a week for meat and drink:</hi> an allowance able to make their skin cleave to their bones! or to make a mans hair ſtand an end that ſhall hear of it! If our ſelves were confined to this allowance, how ſoon ſhould we be weary of it? and yet if they do cry to <hi>Church-wardens, Collectors for the poor, &amp;c.</hi> for what is allowed them, (if they could alwayes have it duly paid) they muſt ſo <hi>crouch, and creep, and be ſo checkt and controlled;</hi> that it would make them ſcorn to accept of it, did not hunger ſo pinch them, that they are compelled whether they will or no, not daring to anger their <hi>good maſters,</hi> for fear of being cut ſhort of that little.</p>

                  <hi>FIrſt,</hi> But let men take heed what they do, and how they uſe theſe poor deſpiſed ones: for <hi>Chriſt and his people are one,</hi> Heb. 2.11. 1 Cor. 12.12. <hi>He is hungry and naked in his members,</hi> Matth. 25.42, 43. <hi>If we neglect them, we neglect him; if we give them, we give to him,</hi> Iſai. 63.9. Matth. 25.44. &amp; 10.40.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> The precept runs thus, <hi>Thou ſhalt love thy neighbour as thy ſelf,</hi> Levit. 19.18. Matth. 19.19. (<hi>a hard leſſon</hi> for men in theſe dayes, wherein <hi>the love of many waxeth cold</hi> to <hi>God</hi> and <hi>man</hi>) yet as hard as it is, <hi>Chriſtians</hi> muſt learn it: If we ſee one in need that cannot help himſelf: we are to care for him, and provide for him in ſome proportion, as we would do for our ſelves; elſe how do we love him as our ſelves? We are willing to ſhare in all that <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> hath; though we deſerve it not: it is but equal that he in his, ſhould ſhare in what we have, though they deſerve it not. <hi>We ought to lay down our lives for the brethren,</hi> 1 John 3.16, 17. Aquila <hi>and</hi> Priſcilla <hi>who for my life, laid down their own necks,</hi> Rom. 16.3, 4. If ſo, then are we to lay down our eſtates for them: for that is leſſe. But</p>
               <pb n="35" facs="tcp:169975:29"/>
               <p> 
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> If on the contrary, we neglect them: we our ſelves ſhall be neglected: you have lived without ſhewing mercy, and you ſhall die without receiving mercy. <hi>Thou in thy life time haſt received thy pleaſure,</hi> (ſayes <hi>Abraham</hi> to <hi>Dives</hi>) <hi>and likewiſe poor</hi> Lazarus <hi>pains: now there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is he comforted, and thou art tormented,</hi> Luke 16.25. It is the poor mans comfort, (if he be pious) that his condition is far better then the rich miſers: for if he have but <hi>a ſmall ſhare in this world,</hi> the other ſhall have <hi>leſs in the world to come.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> They are thine own fleſh, <hi>Hide not thy ſelf from thine own fleſh,</hi> Iſai. 58.7, 11. and not to ſupply their wants to thy power, is to <hi>be without natural affection,</hi> 2 Tim. 3.3. yea, hereby, thou makeſt thy ſelf guilty of all the ſorrows, and ſufferings which thy not giving ſhall occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them. So that <hi>the poor will cry againſt thee; and God will hear their cry, and take their part.</hi> Pſal. 72.12. &amp; 12.5.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fiftly,</hi> What thou giveſt is not loſt, but <hi>lent to the Lord</hi> upon uſury: who will not only <hi>repay it with an hundred fold increaſe here;</hi> but with <hi>ten thouſand fold increaſe hereafter,</hi> Mark 10.30. Proverbs 19.17. <hi>The merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful man does good to his own ſoul,</hi> Prov. 11.17. So that it is not more <hi>for want of grace,</hi> then <hi>wit;</hi> that worldly men are all for heaping up here: ſince thoſe things are worthy moſt eſteem, which are of moſt uſe; and that is <hi>grace, and peace, and a good conſcience:</hi> for theſe <hi>will ſtand us in</hi> great <hi>ſtead at all times; now,</hi> and <hi>hereafter;</hi> and in all caſes, in <hi>health, ſickneſs, death, day of judgement,</hi> and <hi>to eternity.</hi> Whereas wealth with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out grace, hath no ſuch vertue. Indeed many will truſt men with thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands, but not <hi>God:</hi> becauſe they do not know him, nor believe his <hi>Word.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sixtly,</hi> We ſhould give, becauſe we may come to want our ſelves. <hi>Give a portion to ſeven, and alſo to eight: for thou knowest not what evil ſhall come upon the earth,</hi> Eccleſ. 11, 1, 2. <hi>Fire</hi> may come, <hi>thieves, oppreſſours, ſword, famine, over-flowing of waters, &amp;c.</hi> may come: therefore <hi>make frriends by giving to the poor,</hi> Luke 16.9.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Seventhly,</hi> Give, becauſe <hi>to give</hi> is <hi>the way to have,</hi> Luke 6.38. as <hi>part the fourth</hi> plentifully proves. As we <hi>ſowe</hi> more or leſſe, ſo we ſhall <hi>reap</hi> more or leſſe. <hi>Prov.</hi> 11.25. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.6. yea, not to give, is a cauſe of po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty. <hi>To with-hold more then is meet, tendeth to poverty,</hi> Proverbs 11.24, 25. <hi>He becommeth poor, that dealeth with a ſlack hand,</hi> Proverbs 10.4.</p>
               <p>Carnal reaſon will be apt to alleage, I would give; but I fear I ſhall want my ſelf: But the <hi>Lord</hi> ſaith, <hi>He that giveth to the poor ſhall not lack,</hi> Prov. 28.27. <hi>In the dayes of famine, they ſhall have enough,</hi> Job 5.20. Many in theſe our dayes, have had great eſtates, now they have them not; yea, they have not bread to put in their mouthes: one cauſe is, they did not ſupply the wants of others; therefore they are taken from them, and they are in great want themſelves.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Eighthly,</hi> By being unmerciful to the poor, we not only bring the
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:169975:30"/>
                  <hi>judgements of God upon our ſelves,</hi> James 2.13. even <hi>all manner of mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries,</hi> Pſal. 109.8, to 16. Job 20.19, to 25. &amp; 31.16, to 23. Amos 6.1.7, 8: Jer. 5.28, 2<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>. But we bring <hi>plagues upon our poſterity</hi> alſo, Pſal. 109. <hi>Let his children be continually Vagabonds, and beg. Let there be none to extend mercy unto him, neither let there be any to favour his fatherleſs children. Let his posterity be cut off &amp;c. becauſe he remembred not to ſhew mercy, &amp;c.</hi> Verſe 9. to 17. So that a man cannot more hurt himſelf, and wrong his poſterity, then by not helping the poor members of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> when they ſtand in need, nor is there a ſorer evil under the Sun, then to love money better then our ſelves, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 5.13. <hi>Matth.</hi> 25.41, 45.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>As knowing therefore the terrour of the Lord: we perſwade men,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.11. <hi>But to whom ſhall I ſpeak, and give warning that they may hear?
